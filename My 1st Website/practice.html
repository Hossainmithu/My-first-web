<p>The first web browser, called <small>WorldWideWeb</small> WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.[13][14] He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line Mode Browser, which displayed web pages on dumb terminals.[15] The Mosaic web browser was released in April 1993, and was later credited as the first web browser to find mainstream popularity.[16][17] Its innovative graphical user interface made the World Wide Web easy to navigate and thus more accessible to the average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom of the 1990s, when the Web grew at a very rapid rate.[17] <b>Marc Andreessen</b>, the leader of the Mosaic team, started his own company, Netscape, which released the <strong>Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994</strong>. Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.[18]</p>

<p><i>Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008</i>, which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the most popular browser in 2012.[22][23] Chrome has remained dominant ever since.[3] By 2015, Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge for the Windows 10 release.[24] Since the early 2000s, browsers have greatly expanded their <em>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia capabilities</em>. One reason has been to enable more sophisticated websites, such as web apps. Another factor is the significant increase of broadband connectivity, which enables people to access data-intensive content, such as video streaming, that was not possible during the era of dial-up modems.[citation needed]</p>
