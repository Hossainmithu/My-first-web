<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be<b> displayed in a web browser </b>. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as <i>JavaScript</i>.</p>

<p>A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[4][5] <strong>A search engine </strong>is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.[6] <b> In some technical contexts, browsers are referred</b> to as user agents.</p>
